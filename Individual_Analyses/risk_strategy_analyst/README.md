Individual Insights Summary – Risk & Strategy Analyst
Author: Sharon E. White
Role: Risk & Strategy Analyst
Objective: Identify the most critical internal risks and strategic blind spots preventing a legacy retail chain from competing effectively with digital disruptors.

Executive Summary
This analysis followed the DIVE framework to systematically uncover the most serious risk facing our client—a legacy retail chain losing ground to digital competitors. The journey began by assessing external competitive pressures but ultimately revealed through deeper analysis a more critical insight systemic failure in the company's demand forecasting process.
Our key finding is that the company's own flawed planning is a greater threat to its profitability than its competitors. This flawed planning process leads to overstocking, stockouts, and a cascade of inefficiencies that erode both profitability and customer trust. The implication is clear: before the company can compete externally, it must fix itself internally.

DIVE Analysis Journey: A Strategic Risk Narrative

Discover – The Illusion of Competitive Pricing
I began by evaluating whether pricing could be used as a strategic lever.
* Finding: The data revealed that the company operates on razor-thin price margins, engaging in a direct price-matching strategy with its rivals. The average price difference across all categories was negligible.
* Implication: This immediately identified a core strategic threat: the company cannot win on price. Its competitive advantage must be found elsewhere, forcing an investigation into non-price-related factors.

Investigate – The Community Signature Hypothesis
To explore potential competitive advantages, I wanted to examine whether certain stores had unique demand patterns or standout sales categories—what I termed “Community Signatures.”
* Finding: Surprisingly, the data revealed a high degree of uniformity across stores. Customer behavior and product mix were nearly identical system-wide.
* Implication: The lack of differentiation weakens the brand’s ability to serve local markets. It also appeared to justify a uniform, one-size-fits-all operational strategy.

Validate – Uncovering Hidden Operational Risk
As Risk Analyst, I challenged the assumption that store similarity equates to operational uniformity. I conducted a store-level volatility analysis to measure how predictable each store's sales patterns were over time.
* Finding: By analyzing sales volatility, I proved this assumption to be false. While stores had similar average sales, their day-to-day sales predictability varied significantly. Some stores are stable and easy to manage, while others are highly volatile.
* Implication: This invalidates a uniform operational strategy. It proves that a key hidden risk lies in treating all stores the same, as their operational risk profiles are fundamentally different, impacting everything from staffing to inventory.

Extend – The Core Strategic Failure
The final analysis sought to understand the root cause of this operational volatility. The investigation focused on the company's internal demand forecasting process.
* Finding: The forecasts are systematically flawed and biased. They ignore predictable variables like the weather. For example, rain events routinely cause spikes in demand for specific products (e.g., umbrellas, soup), yet the system under-forecasts every time. Conversely, it overestimates demand for items that don’t correlate with weather shifts.
* Implication: This is the root failure. The company is not reacting to market chaos—it is creating its own chaos through avoidable planning errors. The result is a recurring pattern of stockouts, waste, lost revenue, and customer dissatisfaction.

Creative Excellence & Future Work
To validate our findings, we borrowed a concept from supply chain logistics and financial risk modeling: identifying and quantifying systemic bias in forecasting. Just as a financial model must be checked for hidden biases that could lead to catastrophic losses, we tested the company's internal demand forecast and found a significant, predictable "weather bias." This proves the company is creating its own operational risk.
While this insight is powerful, our analysis has limitations. With more time and granular data, we would extend this work by:
Quantifying the Financial Impact: Building a cost model to calculate the exact dollar amount lost to stockouts and wasted inventory caused by this forecast bias.
Developing a Predictive Alert System: Creating a BQML model to proactively flag stores at high risk of forecast error based on upcoming weather patterns, moving from diagnosis to a real-time, preventative solution.


Appendix & Supporting Analyses
In using Tableau to create the visualizations, I was focusing on answering these key questions to support the analysis:

1.  Are we able to see where we have failed in predicting forecasting of the weather?
	Visual:  Forecast vs. Actual

2.  Which stores are hurting the most?
	Visual:  Store Risk Quadrant


3. Which locations are causing us to loose the most money?

Final Reflection
As the Risk and Strategy Analyst, my role was to connect the dots—not just between data points, but between assumptions and outcomes. The investigation revealed that the company's greatest risk is not its competitors—but its own inability to predict and plan for demand. This insight is both urgent and actionable, and if addressed properly, could serve as the catalyst for the company’s full-scale operational transformation.
